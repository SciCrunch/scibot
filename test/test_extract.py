The Lgals9 knockout (KO) mice (strain B6(FVB)-Lgals9tm1.1cfg/Mmucd) were established by Dr. Jim Paulson. The commercial source can purchase from Mutant Mouse Resource and Research Center (MMRRC). Detailed genetic information of Lgals9 KO mice can be found on the CFG functional glycomics gateway site (http://www.functionalglycomics.org/static/consortium/resources/resourcecoref.shtml) or MMRRC (Citation ID: MMRRC_031952-UCD). C57BL/6â€‰J mice were suggested as the wild-type (WT) controls per the MMRRC recommendation. Ten-to-twelve-week-old male mice were used for the experiments. The mice were obtained and bred in Taiwan National Laboratory Animal Center and National Applied Research Laboratories (NARLabs, Taipei, Taiwan), and housed according to the Principles of Laboratory Animal Care. The procedures for animal care and handling were approved by the Animal Committee of China Medical University. There were six to eight mice per group.
